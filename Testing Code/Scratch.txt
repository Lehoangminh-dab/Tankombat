Buttons TEST:
    Add Button to Game.cpp
    Add Render Function to renderMenu
    COMPILE - See if The button is rendered
    Write renderMenuEvents - Add all button.handleEvents(event)
    Reread renderMenuEvents, check if it has poll event yet.
    Check the Clips and Assets dependencies. Remember, we only have 2 button textures at the moment.
    COMPILE - See if button texture changes to yellow when mouse in hovered over.

Buttons FUNCTIONALITY:
    Change isInMenu to false on MOUSE CLICKED
    

Buttons FUNCTIONALITY TEST:
    Check if when clicked, the game initializes tanks and the button is no longer rendered.

Tilemap FUNCTIONALITY:
    Add new tile constants:
        TILE_OBSTACLE_WALL
        ...
    Add corresponding textures and Clips
    COMPILE - Check if new tiles are rendered
    Write new handleObjectsCollision(Tank a, ObstacleTile b)
        Check how IndestructibleObstacle is written
    Add handleObjectsCollision to the main update loop
    Change 3 random tiles in the Desert.map the the new TILE_OBSTACLE_WALL
    COMPILE - Check if tanks will collide with the new tiles.

Cleaning Code:
    Check all the branches you currently have. 
    Delete the ones that are outdated / no longer has useful data
    Merge the current working one with master
    Refactor Code, however you can.

Tilemap MAKING:
    Make a map with the desired tile size, screen width and height
    - Export it to .txt (may have to ask Kien for this one)
    Rewrite screen width and height
    Rewrite loadMap file to the new map file
    Rewrite tile sizes to 32
    COMPILE - See if it manages to render
    COMPILE - SEE if it manages to check collision

Cleaning Code, one last time.
    Film the demo
    Write the readme
    blah blah
    (Just take reference from Trung for this one)
